# 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling

## 📚 Project Overview

This Python project is designed to demonstrate file handling and error management skills. It allows users to input a filename, reads the content of that file, modifies the content (by converting it to uppercase), and writes the modified version to a new file. The program gracefully handles common errors such as missing files or permission issues.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to read from and write to files in Python.
- Learn how to handle exceptions using `try`, `except` blocks.
- Build robust applications that manage unexpected input or system errors.
- Practice modular code design with reusable functions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Reads content from a user-specified file.
- ✨ Modifies the content (currently converts text to uppercase).
- 📝 Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
- 🛡️ Handles errors such as:
  - File not found
  - I/O errors (e.g., permission denied)
